This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: a missing `return` statement within a conditional branch.  This can lead to unexpected behavior, where both the success and error paths execute, resulting in inconsistent responses.

The `bug.js` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.js` provides the corrected version.  The issue stems from the conditional check for a user; if a user is not found, the error message is sent, but the subsequent `res.send(user)` still executes, overriding the 404 response.

This example highlights the importance of using `return` statements to control the flow of execution in asynchronous handlers to ensure that only one response is sent to the client.
